# Empirical-Analysis-of-Human-Rights-Law
This is a student research project from the course "Empirical Analysis of International Human Rights Law" taught at the University of St. Gallen.

# About the project
We inspect and compare the types of human rights violations committed by Switzerland and Slovakia in the last ten years. We make use of data provided by https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng.

Our sample contains 135 cases for Slovakia and 104 cases for Switzerland. There are no double counts.
